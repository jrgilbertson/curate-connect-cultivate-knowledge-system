# Spaced Repetition

Spaced repetition is a learning technique that involves reviewing information at increasing intervals to improve long-term retention. This method systematically schedules reviews at the point when a memory is about to be forgotten, strengthening its neural connections and making it more durable over time.

This technique is like a gardener watering a plant. Rather than flooding the plant with water all at once (cramming), the gardener provides water at optimal, spaced-out intervals. This allows the soil to absorb the water effectively and the roots to grow strong, just as spaced reviews allow the brain to consolidate memories for lasting recall.

For example, when learning Spanish vocabulary, you might review the word "gato" (cat) after one day, then three days, then one week, and then two weeks. Each successful recall pushes the next review further into the future, expanding the interval as the word becomes more firmly embedded in memory.
