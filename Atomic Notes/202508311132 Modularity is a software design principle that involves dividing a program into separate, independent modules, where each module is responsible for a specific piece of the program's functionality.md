# Modularity

Modularity is a software design principle that involves dividing a program into separate, independent modules, where each module is responsible for a specific piece of the program's functionality. This approach makes the overall system easier to understand, develop, test, and maintain by breaking down complexity into manageable parts.

Think of a car's construction. A car is not built as a single, monolithic piece but is assembled from distinct modules like the engine, the transmission, the braking system, and the electrical system. Each module can be designed, built, and tested independently before being integrated into the final product.

For example, a large e-commerce website is built modularly. One module might handle user authentication (login, registration), another manages the product catalog, a third processes payments, and a fourth handles shipping. Each can be updated or replaced without rebuilding the entire website.
