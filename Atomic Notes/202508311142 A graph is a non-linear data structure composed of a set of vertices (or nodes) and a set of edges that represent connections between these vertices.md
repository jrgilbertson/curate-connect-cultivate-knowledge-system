# Graph Data Structure

A graph is a non-linear data structure composed of a set of vertices (or nodes) and a set of edges that represent connections between these vertices. It is used to model relationships between objects, where vertices represent the objects and edges represent the relationships connecting them.

Think of a graph as a city map. Each intersection or landmark is a vertex, and the streets connecting them are the edges. The map doesn't just list the locations; it shows exactly how they are all interconnected, allowing you to find various paths between them.

For example, on a social media platform, each user profile is a vertex, and a "friendship" or "follow" connection between two users is an edge. This graph structure allows the platform to suggest mutual friends and analyze the social network's connections.
