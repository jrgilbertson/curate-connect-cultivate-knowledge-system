# 5W Framework

The 5W framework is a system that uses five quality-gate questions to decide whether to engage with a piece of information. It assesses:

1. An items purpose (what for?)
2. Timeliness (why now?)
3. Opportunity cost (what else?)
4. Source credibility (who from?)
5. Final destination with the knowledge systems (where to?)

Think of the 5W framework as a bouncer at an exclusive club for your mind. Before letting any new information in, the bouncer asks it a series of tough questions. It checks for a valid reason to be there, if it's the right time, who it's associated with, and where it will fit in, preventing mental clutter.

For example, before saving an article about a new programming language, you would ask: "What for?" (to use on a specific project), "Why now?" (the project starts next week), "What else?" (I'm not reading the documentation for my current language), "Who from?" (an industry-leading expert), and "Where to?" (it connects to my [[202508311058 An atomic note is a self-contained unit of knowledge that captures a single, complete idea|atomic notes]] on software development).
