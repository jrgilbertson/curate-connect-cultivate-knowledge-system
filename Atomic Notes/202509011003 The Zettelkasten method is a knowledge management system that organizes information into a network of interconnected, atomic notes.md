# Zettelkasten

The Zettelkasten method is a knowledge management system that organizes information into a [[202508311142 A graph is a non-linear data structure composed of a set of vertices (or nodes) and a set of edges that represent connections between these vertices|network]] of interconnected, [[202508311058 An atomic note is a self-contained unit of knowledge that captures a single, complete idea|atomic notes]]. It transforms a simple collection of notes into a dynamic tool for thinking and creativity by focusing on the relationships between ideas rather than on hierarchical storage.

Think of it as a personal, internal version of Wikipedia. Each note is like a single article focused on one topic, and links connect it to other related articles, allowing you to follow a train of thought and discover unexpected connections between different areas of your knowledge.

For example, a researcher studying productivity might create a note on the "Pomodoro Technique" and link it to other notes on "Time Blocking," "Deep Work," and "Cognitive Load Theory," building a web of related concepts rather than storing them in separate, unrelated documents.
