Hudson says there may be a placebo effect available to marathoners who believe strongly in the benefits of a training volume reduction, but the current narrative seems more likely to produce the opposite effect on performance, a _nocebo_.

_Nocent_ has been in the English language as a word for "harmful" since the 15th century. It comes from Latin _nocēre,_ meaning "to harm." Latin _nocebo_ is a close relative that means "I will be harmful" and that contrasts with _placebo,_ meaning "I shall please."
