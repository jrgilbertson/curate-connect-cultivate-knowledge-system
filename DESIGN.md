# Design Documentation

This document outlines the design decisions, architecture, and rationale behind the Lifelong Learning System Template.

## System Overview

The Lifelong Learning System Template is designed as a flexible knowledge management structure using Obsidian as the primary tool. It provides a structured approach to collecting, processing, and connecting knowledge over time.

## Design Principles

1. **Progressive Organization**: Information flows from raw inputs (literature notes, meeting notes) to processed knowledge (atomic notes, structure notes).
2. **Atomic Knowledge**: Individual concepts are captured as atomic notes that can be linked and referenced across the system.
3. **Flexible Categorization**: Notes can be organized by multiple dimensions (projects, people, places, etc.).
4. **Future-Proofing**: File structure and naming conventions designed to be resilient to tool changes.

## Directory Structure Rationale

- **Atomic Notes**: Core ideas and concepts, each focused on a single topic
- **Attachments**: Binary files and other non-text resources
- **Decisions**: Records of important decisions and their rationale
- **Literature Notes**: Notes from books, articles, papers, and other sources
- **Meetings**: Documentation of discussions and their outcomes
- **People**: Information about individuals
- **Places**: Location-based information
- **Projects**: Project-specific documentation and planning
- **Reviews**: Systematic reviews and reflections
- **Structure Notes**: Maps and frameworks that connect atomic notes
- **Templates**: Reusable formats for different note types
- **Vocabulary Notes**: Definitions and terminology
- **Writing**: Drafts and completed written works

## Technical Considerations

- **Markdown-Based**: All knowledge is stored in plain text Markdown for maximum compatibility
- **Version Control**: Git provides history and collaboration capabilities
- **Tool Independence**: While optimized for Obsidian, the structure works with any Markdown-based system

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with spaced repetition systems
- Automated consistency checks
- Improved visualization of knowledge graphs
