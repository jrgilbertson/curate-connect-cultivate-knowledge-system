## Guidance

This project design template is a strategic tool designed to guide teams through planning, executing, and successfully completing projects. It emphasizes the importance of adaptability, feedback, and continuous improvement as fundamental components of effective project management.

A word of cautionâ€”completing this document should not be mistaken for thorough project planning. It's a dynamic tool meant to evolve alongside your project.

**Project Lead Tips:**

1. **Flexibility:** This template is a foundational guide, not a strict rulebook. It's designed to be adjusted and adapted to fit your project's unique needs and challenges.
2. **Valuable Feedback:** Not all feedback will be equally useful, but every input is an opportunity to learn. Prioritize insights that align with your project goals, but remain open to unexpected lessons.
3. **Team Collaboration:** Project leadership involves guiding the vision and structure of your initiative, but achieving your goals is a team effort. Encourage ownership by delegating sections of this document to team members.
4. **Document Autonomy:** This template should serve as a comprehensive resource for anyone involved in or joining the project at any stage, facilitating onboarding, stakeholder meetings, and project reviews without requiring additional explanation.

**Leadership Tips:**

1. **Engagement:** Post-reading, engage in a detailed walkthrough of this document with your team, sans slides, to foster a deeper understanding and alignment on project goals and strategies.
2. **Beyond Checkboxes:** Encourage your team to approach this document as a living record of their planning and thought processes, not just a formality to be completed.
3. **Contextual Clarity:** Providing clear, upfront context about project expectations and directions can significantly impact your team's motivation and alignment. Misalignments can occur; when they do, own them, clarify, and realign.
4. **Project Visibility:** Keep this document and your project's progress visible and accessible. Encouraging an environment where projects are openly shared allows others to learn from, contribute to, and build upon existing work.
