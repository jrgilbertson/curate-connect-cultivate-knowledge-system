# Project Template

## Overview

This project template, also on GitHub ([link](https://github.com/jrgilbertson/lifelong-learning-system-template/blob/main/Templates/Project%20Template.md)), helps teams navigate each phase of a data project, from planning to deployment and post-launch evaluation. It emphasizes adaptability, feedback, and continuous improvement in project management.

This template isn't just a document to fill out. It's a tool to guide your thinking, facilitate crucial conversations with stakeholders, and ensure you've considered all critical aspects of your project before starting.

This template is a guide, not a rigid set of instructions. It provides structure but does not dictate every step. Projects evolve, and so should your approach. Remain flexible and adapt the template to fit your project's needs rather than forcing it to fit the template.

**Project lead tips:**

- Be flexible and adjust the template as needed. This template is a starting point and guide, not a prescriptive destination.
- Not all feedback is useful, but you can never learn _less_ by listening and gathering input.
- Collaborate on the design. As the project lead, you should own the overall structure and voice, but don't write everything yourself. Involve your team by assigning section ownership.
- This document needs to stand alone. It helps with onboarding, meeting new stakeholders, and project reviews.
- Incorporate feedback loops in key phases, particularly during development and testing, to ensure the project aligns with technical and business goals.

**Leadership tips:**

- After thoroughly reading the document, ask your team to review it. Don't use slides.
- Avoid setting OKRs and goals that focus on completing the document. There's a fine line between incentivizing your team to gather feedback and think through solutions and filling it out to complete a task.
- Provide your team with as much context upfront as possible. It's demotivating for a group to work on a design for weeks only to hear they went in a wildly different direction than expected. It's your responsibility when this happens, so seek further clarity and set better expectations.
- Incentivize your team to keep this document updated throughout the project. If your culture allows, encourage them to make projects discoverable so others can build on their work.
- Encourage ownership, not just accountability. While accountability ensures tasks are completed, ownership fosters a deeper connection to the project's success. Involve your team members in decision-making and give them autonomy to solve problems. When people feel ownership, they're more likely to proactively address challenges and innovate rather than complete tasks to meet deadlines.

## Project Name

Provide a one-sentence overview that emphasizes customer value and defines success.

## Problem Statement

Clearly understand the project's rationale and value. Think expansively rather than reductively at first. For example, ask questions like, "In a perfect world with this data and a great prediction, what would you do?" Rarely is a specific stakeholder ask the right problem to solve. This statement may evolve as you gain insights throughout the project. Here's a starting framework:

- **Situation**: Describe the current context, e.g., "Our platform has experienced increased traffic, but we are not seeing a corresponding rise in conversion rates."
- **Complication**: Articulate the core challenge, e.g., "Despite the increased traffic, conversion rates have stagnated, affecting revenue growth."
- **Solution**: Outline the high-level solution, e.g., "We need to develop a recommendation engine to improve the user experience and boost conversions."

**Tip:** _"Far better an approximate answer to the right question, which is often vague, than an exact answer to the wrong question…"_—John Tukey.

**Tip:** Stop and seek clarity if you don't understand why you are doing this work.

## Current Solutions and Lessons Learned

### Existing Methods

- **Current Solutions**: Summarize past problem-solving efforts, including current solutions. What happens if you don't do this work? A current "good enough" solution is often "good enough." Remember that a yes on your time is a no to other opportunities.
- **Limitations**: Highlight the shortcomings of these methods and explain why new approaches are needed.

### Insights From Related Past Projects

- **What Worked**: Reflect on successful past projects and how those lessons apply here.
- **What Didn't Work**: Acknowledge past issues to avoid them in this project.

**Tip:** Learn from past efforts and comparable products.

**Tip:** Get the basics right. _"It is remarkable how much long-term advantage people like us have gotten by trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of trying to be very intelligent."_—Charlie Munger.

## Objectives and Outcomes

### Objectives

Define and link the project's strategic, long-term goals to broader company goals.

- **Objective 1**: e.g., "Increase revenue by improving customer experience."
- **Objective 2**: Additional objectives as necessary.

### Outcomes

Specify the measurable, short-term outcomes for success and corresponding Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).

- **Outcome 1**: e.g., "Achieve a 10% increase in conversion rates in six months."
- **Outcome 2**: Additional outcomes as necessary.

**Tip:** If you don't understand the high-level goals, keep iterating. They are often very abstract, and it's up to you and the team to refine and articulate them.

## Scope

### In Scope

Clearly define the project's scope to ensure focus and clarity.

- **Feature 1**: e.g., "Developing a machine learning model for personalized recommendations."
- **Feature 2**: Additional in-scope features.

### Out of Scope

Define what is deliberately excluded to prevent scope creep.

- **Exclusion 1**: e.g., "Redesigning the entire user interface."
- **Exclusion 2**: Additional exclusions as necessary.

## Stakeholders and Roles

### Stakeholders

List the key stakeholders involved in the project. The full design must be reviewed with them. They are essential for establishing guidelines, approving requirements and timelines, and giving feedback on the details critical to the project's success.

| Stakeholder   | Name | Responsibilities | Approval Status |
| ------------- | ---- | ---------------- | --------------- |
| Stakeholder 1 |      |                  |                 |
| Stakeholder 2 |      |                  |                 |
| Stakeholder 3 |      |                  |                 |

### Roles

List the key roles required for the project.

| Role   | Name(s) | Responsibilities |
| ------ | ------- | ---------------- |
| Role 1 |         |                  |
| Role 2 |         |                  |
| Role 3 |         |                  |

**Tip:** Don't start development until the scope is _finalized-ish_. You'll know when you're ready. Feedback helps refine the design and encourages people to invest in the results.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

What does the system do? Define the business and technical functionalities required to meet the project objectives.

- **Business Functionality**: e.g., "Business stakeholders need weekly reports on customer churn predictions."
- **Technical Functionality**: e.g., "The system shall generate personalized product recommendations based on user activity."

**Tip:** Include business _and_ technical functionality. Too often, when technical design is separate from product design, the functional requirements are overly technical. This can lead to unintentional scope creep and misaligned deliverables.

### Non-Functional Requirements

How should the system do it? Outline the performance, scalability, and other critical constraints it must meet.

- **Performance**: e.g., "System must generate recommendations within 100ms."
- **Scalability**: e.g., "System should support up to 10,000 concurrent users."
- **Compliance**: e.g., "Must comply with GDPR regulations for data privacy."

## System Design and Architecture

This section outlines a general approach for most data and engineering projects. What will this look like when finished? Be specific—diagrams, a picture or handwritten design, dashboard mocks, etc. Ideally, link to pre-existing resources. The design should evolve as the project progresses.

### Architecture Overview

Provide an overview of the system's architecture and design. Encourage early sketches and refinement over time.

- **System Diagram**: Include an early sketch of the system design. This diagram can evolve with user feedback and testing results.
- **Components**: Describe the main components, such as data storage, processing units, and user interfaces.

### Inputs, Algorithms, and Outputs

Define the inputs, algorithm, and outputs for the system.

- **Inputs**: e.g., "User activity logs from `/data/logs/user_activity/` in JSON format." Document if sources are unknown.
- **Algorithms:** e.g., "The recommendation system uses collaborative filtering, specifically matrix factorization, to generate personalized product recommendations. It processes user-item interaction data, factorizes it into lower-dimensional user and item matrices, and uses these matrices to predict user preferences for unseen items. The model is retrained weekly on historical data and updated daily with incremental learning on new user interactions."
- **Outputs**: e.g., "Recommendation lists stored in Redis using the following structure:
    - Key: `user:<user_id>:recommendations`
    - Value: JSON string of recommendation data
    - Example:

        ```python
        Key: user:12345:recommendations
        Value: {
          "timestamp": "2023-06-15T14:30:00Z",
          "rec_items": ["item1", "item2", "item3"],
          "rec_scores": [0.95, 0.85, 0.75],
          "model_version": "v1.2"
        }
        ```

    - Each Redis entry represents a set of personalized recommendations for a specific user at a given time. The JSON string contains the following fields:
        - `timestamp`: Time recommendations were generated.
        - `rec_items`: List of recommended item IDs.
        - `rec_scores`: Corresponding recommendation scores.
        - `model_version`: Version of the model used for recommendations."

**Tip:** It can be tempting to spend too much time on algorithms during a project, so use this documentation to set guardrails.

### Product Usage

Explain how the system will be used and integrated into the broader ecosystem.

- **Usage Scenarios**: e.g., "After logging in, users receive personalized product recommendations on their homepage."
- **Interacting Systems**: e.g., "E-commerce platform frontend for displaying recommendations."

## Deliverables

What are the final deliverables? They should be linked to objectives and outcomes and agreed upon with stakeholders. Based on feedback and project progress, they may be adjusted or reprioritized.

- **Deliverable 1**: e.g., "Deployed recommendation engine integrated into the e-commerce platform."
- **Deliverable 2**: e.g., "Comprehensive documentation, including technical specifications and user guides."
- **Deliverable 3**: e.g., "Training sessions for relevant teams on system usage and maintenance."

## Milestone Plan

This plan outlines key project milestones with target dates. The team will determine how to achieve these through their preferred sprint or work cycle structure. Target dates may shift as the project progresses and the team learns more, notably in Agile environments. Regular check-ins will help stay aligned and adjust the plan. Covering the "what" and "when" in a milestone plan is important.

| Milestone   | Description                                                          | Jira Epic(s)       | Deliverable(s)              | Due Date |

**Tip:** Each epic should represent a significant, distinct functionality or body of work within the project.

## Risk Management

Identify potential risks and mitigation strategies.

- **Risk 1**: e.g., "Data privacy breaches from improper handling of user data."
    - **Likelihood**: Medium
    - **Impact**: High
    - **Mitigation Plan**: Implement strict access controls, data encryption, and regular security audits.
- **Risk 2**: e.g., "Model accuracy not meeting performance criteria."
    - **Likelihood**: Medium
    - **Impact**: Medium
    - **Mitigation Plan**: Allocate time for model tuning, use cross-validation, and plan for multiple iterations.

## Ethics, Security, and Compliance

### Ethical Considerations

Evaluate the ethical implications of the project.

- **Bias and Fairness**: e.g., "Ensure the recommendation engine doesn't favor certain user groups."

### Security Measures

Ensure the system follows security best practices.

- **Data Protection**: e.g., "Encrypt all stored user data using AES-256."

### Compliance Requirements

Ensure the system complies with regulatory standards.

- **Compliance**: e.g., "Ensure GDPR and CCPA compliance for user data handling."

## Close-Out Plan

### Project Completion

Ensure stakeholders complete and accept all agreed-upon deliverables.

### Maintenance and Handover

- **Ongoing Maintenance**: Plan for system monitoring, updates, runbooks, and support.
- **Handover Plan**: Provide thorough documentation and training if the project is handed off to another team.
