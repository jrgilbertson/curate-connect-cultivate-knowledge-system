## Performance Audit

Leverage your weekly summaries and daily notes for a streamlined review.

1. **Highlights:** What worked well this quarter? What patterns show promise and should be scaled?
2. **Lowlights:** What didn't work well? What obstacles did you face? What are you consistently avoiding or putting off?
3. **Opportunities:** Based on your reflections, where are your biggest opportunities for growth and improvement next quarter?

## Action Plan

1. **Top 3 Goals:** List all your goals and then define your three most important ones for next quarter. All other goals become your "avoid-at-all-costs" list until one of the top three is completed.
2. **Action Steps:** For each goal, outline specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) action steps.
3. **Habit Adjustments:** Based on your performance audit and metrics, what changes do you need to make to your daily or weekly habits to better support your goals?
