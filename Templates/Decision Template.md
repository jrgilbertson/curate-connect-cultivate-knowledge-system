# Decision Template

This decision template combines key elements from various decision-making frameworks, including second-order thinking, Munger's inversion technique, scenario analysis, and the DECIDE model. It offers a comprehensive yet practical approach to complex decision-making.

Instructions for use:

1. Use this template for significant decisions that have long-term implications or complex consequences.
2. It's best suited for strategic business decisions, major personal life choices, or any situation with high stakes, and multiple factors need to be considered.
3. Fill out each section thoughtfully, considering various perspectives and potential outcomes.
4. Be honest about probabilities and potential risks.
5. Revisit the retrospective section after sufficient time to learn from the decision's outcomes.

## Define the Situation

1. What is the problem or opportunity you're facing
2. What are the key constraints or parameters?
3. What are the success criteria?

## Identify Options

Include the status quo, if relevant.

1. Option A:
2. Option B:
3. Option C:

## Analysis of Each Option

Use the following structure for each option.

### Option A

#### First-Order Consequences

1. What are the immediate and direct results of choosing this option? List 2-3 key outcomes that are likely to occur in the short term.

#### Second-Order Thinking

1. What might happen next? (2-3 key "And then what?" scenarios)
2. Who else might be affected, and how might they react?

#### Scenario Analysis

Assign a probability score to each.

1. Best case outcome:
2. Moderate case outcome:
3. Worst case outcome:

#### Consensus View

1. How does this option align with or differ from the consensus view?
2. What if the consensus view is correct?

#### Inversion

1. How could this option lead to failure?
2. What can be done to prevent or mitigate these risks?

## Decision and Rationale

1. Which option is chosen and why?
2. How does it compare to the other options regarding potential outcomes and risks?

## Next Steps

1. What are the immediate actions to implement this decision?
2. How will you monitor its effectiveness?

## Retrospective

1. What happened?
2. How did the outcomes compare to your expectations?
3. What lessons were learned?
