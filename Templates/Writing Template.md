## Outline Template

A general template adaptable for various outputs such as novels, essays, articles, research papers, blog posts, and more. For lengthier or more complex works, such as novels or extensive research papers, one may need to further divide the outline into chapters or sections, each with its own set of main points and supporting details. Additionally, the structure and components may vary depending on the specific requirements of the writing output or genre.

1. Governing Thought: Identify the work's central idea or main theme. This component may only sometimes be explicitly stated in the outline but should inform the structure and content of the work.
2. Introduction:
	1. Hook: An engaging opening sentence or paragraph that captures the reader's attention.
	2. Context/Background: Provide any necessary context or background information to set the stage for the work.
	3. Thesis Statement (optional): A concise summary of the main point or claim, encapsulating the governing thought.
3. Body/Main Content:
	1. Main Point 1:
		1. Topic Sentence: A sentence that conveys the main idea of this section or paragraph and connects it to the thesis statement (if applicable) and governing thought.
		2. Supporting Details: Provide evidence, examples, or explanations to support and develop the main point.
		3. Analysis/Interpretation (if using a thesis statement): Explain how the supporting details relate to the main point and overall argument.
		4. Transition sentence: Use clear and effective transitions when moving from one main point or section to another. This helps maintain coherence and connect the writing to the governing thought and thesis statement.
	2. Additional Main Points: Repeat this structure for each main point or section of the work.
4. Conclusion/Final Thoughts:
	1. Summary/Recap: Summarize the main points or sections of the work and restate the thesis statement (if applicable), reinforcing the governing thought.
	2. Implications/Significance: Discuss the broader implications or significance of the work, connecting it to the governing thought.
	3. Call-to-Action or Closing Remarks: Leave the reader with a final thought or message that encourages further reflection or action.
