# Getting Started with the Curate, Connect, Cultivate System

This guide will help you understand the journey from encountering information to building a connected knowledge system.

## The Journey: From Information to Understanding

Every piece of knowledge in this system follows a simple but powerful journey:

1. **Encounter** → You find something interesting (article, idea, conversation)
2. **Capture** → Quick save to your Inbox folder for later processing
3. **Curate** → Decide if it's worth keeping (most things aren't)
4. **Transform** → Convert into an atomic note (one concept, clearly expressed)
5. **Connect** → Link to existing notes and add to structure notes
6. **Cultivate** → Review, refine, and evolve over time

## Understanding the Folder Structure

Each folder serves a specific purpose in your knowledge workflow:

- **Inbox/** - Your capture zone. Everything starts here before processing.
- **Atomic Notes/** - Single-concept notes with timestamps (YYYYMMDDHHMM format) for unique identification.
- **Structure Notes/** - Maps that organize and connect related atomic notes by topic or theme.
- **Reference Notes/** - Literature notes from books, articles, and external sources you're processing.
- **Reviews/** - Daily, weekly, and quarterly reflections that track your learning journey.
- **Templates/** - Consistent starting points for different note types.
- **People/**, **Projects/**, **Meetings/** - Context-specific notes for professional knowledge work.

## Using the Templates

Templates provide consistent structure without constraining creativity:

### Essential Templates

1. **Atomic Note Template** - For capturing single concepts
   - Use when: You want to record one discrete idea or insight
   - Key feature: Structured format ensures clarity and retrievability

2. **Daily Note Template** - For daily reflection and capture
   - Use when: Starting or ending your day
   - Key feature: Links the day's experiences to your growing knowledge

3. **Weekly Review Template** - For pattern recognition and planning
   - Use when: Weekly reflection sessions
   - Key feature: Surfaces patterns and guides upcoming focus

### Creating Your First Atomic Note

1. Start with something you learned today
2. Ask yourself: "What's the one core idea here?"
3. Create a new note from the Atomic Note Template
4. Give it a timestamp filename (YYYYMMDDHHMM) and descriptive title
5. Write the concept in your own words
6. Add relevant aliases (alternative terms you might search for)
7. Link to related notes if any exist

## Core Principles to Remember

- **Quality over quantity**: Better to have 10 well-crafted atomic notes than 100 unprocessed clips
- **Your own words matter**: Rewriting in your language creates understanding
- **Connections compound**: Each link between notes multiplies the value of both
- **Start small**: Begin with one atomic note per day
- **Evolution is expected**: Notes should change as your understanding deepens

## Next Steps

1. Create your first daily note to capture today's thoughts
2. Process one item from your inbox into an atomic note
3. Create a structure note for a topic you're currently learning
4. Establish a simple daily rhythm (10 minutes morning, 15 minutes evening)

Remember: This system grows with you. Start simple, stay consistent, and let the connections emerge naturally.
