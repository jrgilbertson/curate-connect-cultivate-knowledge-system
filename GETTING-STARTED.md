# Getting Started Guide

Welcome! This guide will walk you through exploring and using the Curate, Connect, Cultivate knowledge system. By the end, you'll understand how to create, connect, and cultivate your own knowledge network.

## Before You Begin

**Prerequisites:**
- [ ] Obsidian installed and opened
- [ ] This vault loaded in Obsidian
- [ ] 30 minutes of focused time

**What You'll Accomplish:**
- Explore the existing knowledge network
- Create your first [[202508311058 An atomic note is a self-contained unit of knowledge that captures a single, complete idea|atomic note]]
- Connect it to the system
- Set up your daily workflow

## Part 1: Explore the System (10 minutes)

### Start with the Main Hub

1. **Open the [[Curate, Connect, Cultivate System]] [[202509011019 A structure note serves as a curated entry point or an organized overview of a specific topic or line of thought within a note network|structure note]]**
	- Located in `Structure Notes/` folder
	- This is your main navigation hub
	- Click through 2-3 linked [[202508311058 An atomic note is a self-contained unit of knowledge that captures a single, complete idea|atomic notes]] to see how concepts connect

### Understand the Core Components

2. **Explore an [[202508311058 An atomic note is a self-contained unit of knowledge that captures a single, complete idea|Atomic Note]]**
	- Notice the timestamp format (YYYYMMDDHHMM)
	- See the [[202509030636 The DAE framework is a structured method for writing atomic notes that ensures clarity and retention by organizing each note into three parts—a concise Definition, a relatable Analogy, and a concrete Example|DAE]] structure: Definition, Analogy, Example
	- Check the aliases and connections at the bottom

3. **Follow a Connection**
	- Click a link to another note
	- Notice how concepts build on each other
	- Use the backlinks panel to see what links here

### See the Organization

4. **Browse the [[202509011019 A structure note serves as a curated entry point or an organized overview of a specific topic or line of thought within a note network|Structure Notes]]**
	- Each one is a topic map for related concepts
	- Notice how some [[202508311058 An atomic note is a self-contained unit of knowledge that captures a single, complete idea|atomic notes]] appear in multiple structures
	- This is intentional—knowledge is networked, not hierarchical

## Part 2: Create Your First [[202508311058 An atomic note is a self-contained unit of knowledge that captures a single, complete idea|Atomic Note]] (15 minutes)

### Choose Your Concept

1. **Think of something you learned recently**
	- A concept from work
	- An insight from reading
	- A pattern you've noticed

	Ask yourself: "What's the ONE core idea here?"

### Use the Template

2. **Create a new note from template**
	- Click the "Create new note" button
	- Apply the `Templates/Atomic Note Template`
	- Name it: `YYYYMMDDHHMM Your concept in a complete sentence.md`
	- Example: `202501151430 Compound interest applies to knowledge not just money.md`

### Fill in the Structure

3. **Write your note using [[202509030636 The DAE framework is a structured method for writing atomic notes that ensures clarity and retention by organizing each note into three parts—a concise Definition, a relatable Analogy, and a concrete Example|DAE]]**
	- **Definition** (20-60 words): Explain the concept in your own words
	- **Analogy**: Compare it to something familiar
	- **Example**: Give a concrete instance

4. **Add metadata**
	- Add 2-3 aliases (other ways you might search for this)
	- Link to related notes if any exist (it's OK if none do yet)

### Connect to the System

5. **Add to a [[202509011019 A structure note serves as a curated entry point or an organized overview of a specific topic or line of thought within a note network|Structure Note]]**
	- Open the most relevant [[202509011019 A structure note serves as a curated entry point or an organized overview of a specific topic or line of thought within a note network|structure note]]
	- Add a link to your new [[202508311058 An atomic note is a self-contained unit of knowledge that captures a single, complete idea|atomic note]]

## Part 3: Set Up Your Workflow (5 minutes)

### Configure Daily Notes

1. **Set up the hotkey**
	- Settings → Hotkeys → Search "daily note"
	- Set to something memorable (e.g., Cmd/Ctrl + D)
	- Test it to create today's daily note

### Establish Your Rhythm

2. **Morning Capture (5 minutes)**
	- Open daily note
	- Capture thoughts, tasks, ideas in the Inbox section
	- Don't process yet—just capture

3. **Evening Process (10 minutes)**
	- Review the day's captures
	- Convert worthy items to [[202508311058 An atomic note is a self-contained unit of knowledge that captures a single, complete idea|atomic notes]]
	- Link and connect
	- Delete the rest without guilt

### Schedule Weekly Review

4. **Pick your review day**
	- Add a recurring calendar reminder
	- Use the [[Weekly Review template]]
	- Focus: patterns, connections, pruning

## Common Questions

**Q: How do I know if something deserves to be an [[202508311058 An atomic note is a self-contained unit of knowledge that captures a single, complete idea|atomic note]]?**
A: Use the [[202509030651 The 5W framework is a system that uses five quality-gate questions to decide whether to engage with a piece of information|5W framework]]: What for? Why now? What else? Who from? Where to? If it passes 3+ questions, it's worth capturing.

**Q: What if I can't find connections to other notes?**
A: We discourage orphan notes—every [[202508311058 An atomic note is a self-contained unit of knowledge that captures a single, complete idea|atomic note]] should have at least one home. If your new note doesn't fit existing [[202509011019 A structure note serves as a curated entry point or an organized overview of a specific topic or line of thought within a note network|structure notes]], that's a signal to create a new [[202509011019 A structure note serves as a curated entry point or an organized overview of a specific topic or line of thought within a note network|structure note]] for this emerging topic. Even if it starts with just one [[202508311058 An atomic note is a self-contained unit of knowledge that captures a single, complete idea|atomic note]], the [[202509011019 A structure note serves as a curated entry point or an organized overview of a specific topic or line of thought within a note network|structure note]] ensures discoverability and provides a place for related notes to gather as your understanding grows.

**Q: Should I import my existing notes?**
A: No. Start fresh. Only bring in notes as you need to reference them, rewriting them in atomic format.

**Q: How many [[202509011019 A structure note serves as a curated entry point or an organized overview of a specific topic or line of thought within a note network|structure notes]] should I have?**
A: Start with the three provided. Create new ones whenever you have [[202508311058 An atomic note is a self-contained unit of knowledge that captures a single, complete idea|atomic notes]] that don't fit existing structures—even if it's just one note on a new topic. This prevents orphans and creates space for related notes to gather.
