# Daily Review

For 2025-09-01.

## Today

What went well? (1–3 bullets; include 1 evidence link if possible)

1. x

What was difficult? (1–3 bullets; name the cause, not the symptom)

1. x

What was [[202504231231 The Stoic dichotomy of control divides reality into things we can control—our judgments, desires, and actions—and things we cannot, such as external events, other people, and outcomes|outside my control]]? What did I choose anyway? (one line, action you control)

1. x → I chose (action, time-bound)

Gratitude, notes, and other reflections.

## Tomorrow

Top priorities (1–3). Protect 3 hours for deep work. Define "done when" as a clear yes/no tied to a visible artifact or state, small enough to finish today and within your control; aim for good enough—not perfect. If others are involved, name the explicit handoff.

1. x - Done when y

Obstacles → mitigation → fallback (max 3). Call out the few likely blockers for tomorrow. For each, choose a mitigation you control (e.g., ping owner at 9:00, prep an outline, pre-download data) and a time-bound fallback you'll switch to if still blocked (e.g., "if not unblocked by 10:30, move to Y"). Keep it small and concrete—the goal is to remove friction, not perfect the plan.

1. x → y → z
