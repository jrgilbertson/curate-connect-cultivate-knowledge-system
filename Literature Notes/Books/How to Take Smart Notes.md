## Comments

- This literature note is an example of what Readwise generates from Kindle highlights. I add my own thoughts and create atomic notes in this comments section.
- Example atomic note: [[202201101401 Structure, or index, notes in a Zettelkasten create an entry point into a line of thought or topic]]

## Highlights

- A good structure enables flow, the state in which you get so completely immersed in your work that you lose track of time and can just keep on going as the work becomes effortless (Csikszentmihalyi, 1975). Something like that does not happen by chance. [Location 195]
- 1.  The first type of links are those on notes that are giving you the overview of a topic. These are notes directly referred to from the index and usually used as an entry point into a topic that has already developed to such a degree that an overview is needed or at least becomes helpful. On a note like this, you can collect links to other relevant notes to this topic or question, preferably with a short indication of what to find on these notes (one or two words or a short sentence is sufficient). This kind of note helps to structure thoughts and can be seen as an in-between step towards the development of a manuscript. Above all, they help orientate oneself within the slip-box. You will know when you need to write one. Luhmann collected up to 25 links to other notes on these kind of entry notes. They don't have to be written in one go as links can be added over time, which again shows how topics can grow organically. What we think is relevant for a topic and what is not depends on our current understanding and should be taken quite seriously: It defines an idea as much as the facts it is based on. What we regard as being relevant for a topic and how we structure it will change over time. This change might lead to another note with a different, more adequate topic structure, which then can be seen as a comment on the previous note. Thankfully, it won't make all the other notes redundant. As mentioned before: All we have to do is to change the entry in the index to this new note and/or indicate on the old note that we now consider a new structure more fitting. [Location 2064]
- Comparing notes also helps us to detect contradictions, paradoxes or oppositions [Location 2127]
    - Note: Add paradox to vocab
- 2.  Add links to other notes or links on other notes to your new note. 3.  Make sure it can be found from the index; add an entry in the index if necessary or refer to it from a note that is connected to the index. 4.  Build a Latticework of Mental Models [Location 1961]
    - Note: Every note needs a [[202201101401 Structure, or index, notes in a Zettelkasten create an entry point into a line of thought or topic|structure note]]
