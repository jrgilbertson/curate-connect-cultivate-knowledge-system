_Note: This repository demonstrates the open-source Curate, Connect, Cultivate knowledge management methodology for human-AI collaboration. A comprehensive book expanding on these concepts is forthcoming in 2026. For information or early access, contact jason.gilbertson@gmail.com._

## Overview

This is an Obsidian-based personal knowledge management system template that provides a structured approach to organizing notes, knowledge, and information using the Curate, Connect, Cultivate methodology.

## Curate, Connect, Cultivate Methodology

### Why Traditional Knowledge Management Fails

Most knowledge management systems fail for the same reasons. Tags proliferate into hundreds of variations—"productivity" becomes "productive," "getting-things-done," "GTD," "efficiency," each creating another silo. Folders force artificial hierarchies on naturally networked information. Search breaks down when you can't remember if you wrote "transformer" or "attention model."

The deeper problem is that we confuse collecting with understanding. Every saved article feels productive, but saving isn't learning. We build warehouses of facts when we need gardens of understanding.

Even sophisticated systems like Luhmann's Zettelkasten, which produced 70 books and 500+ articles, require adaptation for our current context. Digital tools and AI collaboration demand structure that didn't exist in the paper-based world of the 1960s.

### Three Core Practices

The Curate, Connect, Cultivate methodology addresses these fundamental issues:

- **Curate**: Practice selective capture based on clear criteria. Not everything deserves to be saved. Each piece of information should earn its place through genuine utility or insight. This constraint forces actual engagement with ideas rather than deferred understanding.
- **Connect**: Build explicit relationships between ideas using aliases, backlinks, and cross-references. Knowledge naturally forms networks, not hierarchies. Multiple pathways to the same concept mirror how human memory works and how AI systems process information.
- **Cultivate**: Maintain a living system through consistent practices. Notes evolve as understanding deepens. Connections strengthen through use. Outdated information gets pruned or updated. The system becomes more valuable over time through active tending.

### Five Principles That Enable Human-AI Collaboration

The methodology operates on five principles:

1. **Atomic thinking with consistent structure**: One idea per note, with internal organization that supports both human understanding and machine parsing. Each note answers a single, clear question.
2. **Selective curation using explicit criteria**: Information must be worth your future self's time. The discipline of choosing creates understanding that collecting never can.
3. **Explicit connections through aliases and links**: Relationships between ideas must be visible and navigable. Implicit organization fails at scale.
4. **Natural language for broad accessibility**: Clear writing that your future self can understand is also what AI systems can work with effectively.
5. **Evolution through active maintenance**: Understanding changes over time. Notes should reflect that growth rather than remaining static artifacts.

### A System Designed for How We Actually Think

This approach works because it aligns with cognitive science research on how humans process and retain information. When you write in your own words, create explicit connections, and regularly review and refine, you engage the same mechanisms that create lasting understanding.

The compatibility with AI systems isn't coincidental. Large language models process information through patterns and relationships—exactly what this methodology makes explicit. Your knowledge system becomes a thinking partner that both you and AI tools can navigate effectively.

- **People/** - Notes about individuals you interact with or study
- **Places and Things/** - Notes about locations, objects, and tools
- **Projects/** - Project documentation and planning
- **Reference Notes/** - Notes from books, articles, and other external sources
- **Reviews/** - Periodic reviews and reflections
	- **Daily Notes/** - Daily journals and reflections
	- **Decisions/** - Decision logs and analysis
	- **Interviews/** - Interview notes and feedback
	- **Quarterly Reviews/** - Quarterly assessments and goal setting
	- **Weekly Review/** - Weekly summaries and planning
- **Structure Notes/** - Index note that connect related concepts
