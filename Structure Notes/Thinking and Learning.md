# Thinking and Learning

## Philosophy

## Spaced Repetition

1. [[202509010952 Spaced repetition is a learning technique that involves reviewing information at increasing intervals to improve long-term retention]]
2. [[202509010956 The Ebbinghaus forgetting curve is a model showing how memory retention declines exponentially over time if there is no attempt to review the learned information]]
