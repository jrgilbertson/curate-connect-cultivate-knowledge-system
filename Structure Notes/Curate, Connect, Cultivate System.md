# Curate, Connect, Cultivate System

## Foundational Concepts

1. [[202509011003 The Zettelkasten method is a knowledge management system that organizes information into a network of interconnected, atomic notes]]
2. [[202508311058 An atomic note is a self-contained unit of knowledge that captures a single, complete idea]]
3. [[202509011019 A structure note serves as a curated entry point or an organized overview of a specific topic or line of thought within a note network]]
4. [[202509030621 A reference note captures key ideas from an external source, serving as a bridge between consuming information and creating original thought]]

## Frameworks

1. [[202509030636 The DAE framework is a structured method for writing atomic notes that ensures clarity and retention by organizing each note into three partsâ€”a concise Definition, a relatable Analogy, and a concrete Example]]
2. [[202509030651 The 5W framework is a system that uses five quality-gate questions to decide whether to engage with a piece of information]]
